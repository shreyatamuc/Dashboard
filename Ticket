### **Acceptance Criteria**

Cuboid should be able to transfer accounts in bulk.

---

### **Business Requirement**

**As a Flexcanada Business User**, I want **Cuboid**:

* To allow the system to add bulk accounts in the branch transfer functionality screen.
* Because in the event of branch transfer, SWIFT preferences are not automatically sent to GSD.
* There’s currently a manual activity to remove and re-add preferences post-migration to trigger SWIFT preferences.
* As bulk transfer is approaching, this overhead is unsustainable.
* Options should be explored to **automate SWIFT preferences**.

**So that** the **Custody business** can successfully achieve **bulk account branch transfers**.

---

### **CQE Team Validation Requirements**

1. Check the account branch transfer screen and confirm the maximum number of accounts allowed as input.
2. Validate that accounts from different account classes can be input in the same request.
3. Check if the EOD (End of Day) has any impact on the transfer.
4. Ensure all accounts starting BOD (Beginning of Day) are migrated to branch 157.
5. Validate account refresh sent to different PP’s.
6. Ensure account refresh is sent to SECORE and transactions flow successfully through Cuboid.
7. Customer data (via batch file) and adhoc files must be sent to SECORE.
8. Validate GCE Sweeps and Citidirect access.

### **Things to Consider**

* Certain account classes are restricted in branch code 157. Transfers to this branch will be rejected for these cases.
* Ensure that the account class is not restricted in the new branch (157) before proceeding.

**Restricted Combinations:**

| BUSINESS\_GROUP | ACCOUNT\_CLASS | BRANCH\_CODE |
| --------------- | -------------- | ------------ |
| DCC             | DS2021         | 157          |
| DCC             | DS2082         | 157          |
| DCC             | DS2084         | 157          |
| DCC             | DS2021         | 157          |

---

### **Customer Data Issue**

* During analysis, 7 customers had their **local branch as 155**.
* This field **cannot be updated from the frontend**.

**Resolution Options:**

1. Ignore the field if unused.
2. Create a new base number in 157 and perform customer transfer.
